# unibo-computer-eng-toolkit

I'm Davide, a [Computer Engineering](corsi.unibo.it/laurea/IngegneriaInformatica) student at the University of Bologna (unibo), enrolled since 2022.

This repo collects some of the libraries and utilities I’ve built for my courses. 

**Warning**: It’s not a complete collection (yet!)—just the ones I’ve bothered to upload. If you’re looking for something specific, feel free to ask!

**Disclaimer**: No guarantees—this code might save your homework or crash your IDE. Proceed at your own risk!
